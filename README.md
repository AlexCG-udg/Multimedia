Information architecture:


In this project, I aimed to create a clean, intuitive, top-down scrolling structure. At the top of the page, the name of the CV’s owner is displayed to capture attention right away. Below the first header there’s an “About Me” section with a photo that provides an overview of the person’s qualities, skills, and aspirations, helping viewers quickly understand the individual’s motivations.

Following the introductory section, there’s an Academic Background area that lists educational background. This section offers his academic history, presented in a list format for easy reading. Next, a Work Experience section highlights relevant professional roles, also formatted as a list to maintain consistency and readability. Next, a Skills and Languages sections. Finally, an Academic Projects section showcases notable work, giving an idea of past projects and skills developed.

The "Contact Information" section at the bottom provides essential details like phone number, email, and address in a simple list format. Its clear, concise layout allows potential employers or contacts to quickly find how to reach the user.

Visual design:


For this project, I aimed for a minimalist visual design to demostrate clarity and a clean layout.
This decision makes the site easy to read and navigate without distractions. I selected a monochromatic blue color palette, because blue transmist calm, and professionalism. This choice of blue also highlights the important elements, such as headers.

The typography I've choosed is Roboto, it fits with minimalist aesthetic, complementing the overall clean style without drawing unnecessary attention to itself. The font size and line spacing have been adjusted for readability.

The layout emphasizes balance and alignment, with structured sections for easy navigation. Elements such as borders, shadows, and spacing were added to add depth.
